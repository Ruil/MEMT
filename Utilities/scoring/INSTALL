Run ./setup.sh .  When that finishes, run ./score.rb for usage instructions.  

Due to licensing issues, the actual metrics are not distributed in the same tarball.  ./setup.sh will download, untar, and compile them in the case of METEOR.  

Run time dependencies are Ruby (scoring script), Perl (detokenizer and BLEU), and Java (METEOR and TER).

At build time you also need Python (METEOR phrase table extraction) and Ant (to build METEOR).
