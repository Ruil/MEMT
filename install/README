This automates installation of packages from source into a prefix directory.  
Command line is ./install.sh /some/prefix/directory "list of packages in order" -jparallelism where parallelism is the number of processors to use.
You probably want to set the environment variables CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS to something efficient.  See http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Safe_Cflags for guidance.  

Once installed, you can run either
source /some/prefix/directory/environment.bash
or
source /some/prefix/directory/environment.tcsh
depending on your shell to setup the environment to use the installed packages.  

Packages are:
antlr-2 antlr-3 apr apr-util boost boost_jam ftjam git icu neon openssl ruby sasl sqlite sri subversion wordnet

You probably don't need all of them.  All the packages except sri download their source automatically.

For MEMT's dependencies, run ./install.sh /some/prefix/directory "icu boost boost_jam ruby" -jparallelism

Dependencies:
MEMT decoder source code (provided separately) -> icu boost boost_jam
MEMT tuning scripts (provided separately) -> ruby
boost -> icu
git -> openssl
git with git svn support -> subversion
subversion -> apr apr-util openssl sasl sqlite
subversion with ruby support -> ruby
neon -> openssl
apr-util -> apr
socat -> openssl


Note that there is no separate make and make install as some packages' make depends on other packages' make install, so there would be several iterations.
